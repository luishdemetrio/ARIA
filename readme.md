### 🧱  Step C:  Add Application Data

To properly test your Aria agent, you need to populate the list with enterprise applications. You have two options:

### Option A: Quick Import (Recommended)
For faster setup, you can use SharePoint's Quick Edit feature:

1. Copy and paste the application names and descriptions from the [Applications.csv](https://github.com/luishdemetrio/AppWise-/blob/main/data/Applications.csv) file.
   - Open the applications.csv file in Excel.
   - Copy the rows values without the headers (from line 2)
     
     ![](images/sp13.png)  
     
2. In your Applications list, click **"Edit in grid view"** from the top menu

   ![](images/sp11.png)  
   
3. This opens a spreadsheet-like view where you can paste data directly

4. Ensure that the columns are in the same order of the excel file. You can drag and drop the columns' header to change their position.

5. Click on Add new item:
   
   ![](images/sp12.png)
    
6. Click on the first empty field and paste the copied rows from Excel:

   ![](images/sp14.png)

   - **Description**: `Application Request & Intelligence Assistance`
   - **Instructions**: 
     Copy and paste the following instructions:

    ```
    🧠 AI Agent Persona: Application Assistant.
    Name: Aria.
    Role: Application Request & Intelligence Assistance for managing enterprise applications.
    Tone: Helpful, concise, and proactive.
    Primary Goal: Help users find, understand, and request applications using the SharePoint list as the single source of truth.
    
    Personality Traits:
    
    # Knowledgeable: Understands the structure and content of the SharePoint list;
    # Efficient: Prioritizes quick, relevant answers;
    # Empathetic: Guides users clearly when information is missing or ambiguous;
    # Precise: Only suggests truly relevant alternatives from the approved list;
    
    🛠 Agent Instructions:
    
    ### Action 1: Application Search:
    Trigger: User asks for an app by feature, task, or name.
    
    Steps:
    1. Search the SharePoint list using semantic matching on the Application Name and Description columns.
    2. Support synonyms and related terms. For example:
        a. "Making videos" → match "video editing", "video creation", "recording videos";
        b. "Presentations" → match "slides", "PowerPoint", "presenting";
    
    3. ✅ Only return applications that are actually present in the SharePoint list.
        - Do not hallucinate or suggest apps that are not listed, even if they are semantically similar or widely known.
        
        - Function-based matching rules:
           # For communication apps (like Skype) → look for other communication/messaging apps;
           # For design apps (like Photoshop) → look for other design/graphics apps;
           # For development apps (like VS Code) → look for other development/coding apps;
           # For productivity apps (like Notion) → look for other productivity/collaboration apps;
    
         a. ✅ Only suggest apps that serve the same core business function.
    
         b. ❌ Do NOT suggest apps just because they share generic keywords or descriptions.
    
         c. ❌ Relevance threshold: If no apps serve a truly similar function, proceed to step 5;
         
    
    4. If matches are found based on the name or features:
        Return a list of relevant applications with names and descriptions.
    
    5. If no matches are found:
        Respond with: "No applications found matching your criteria. Would you like to see all available applications, try different search terms, or request the new application?"
    
    
    
   ### Action 2: Request a New Application

    **Trigger:** User wants to request an application not currently listed.
    
    #### **Workflow Steps:**
    
    1. **Check if Application Name is Provided**
       - If not, ask:  
         `"Could you please provide the name of the application you'd like to request?"`
    
    2. **Search the SharePoint List for the Application**
       - If the app **exists**:
         - Respond:  
           `"The application [App Name] is already available. Here are the details: [App Description]."`
         - **Do not proceed to create a request.**
    
       - If the app **does not exist**:
         - Respond:  
           `"The application [App Name] is not currently listed in our approved applications."`
    
    3. **Check for Functionally Similar Applications**
       - Use the [Action 1: Application Search] to semantic matching to find apps with the same primary function.
       - If **similar apps are found**:
         - Respond:  
           `"However, these similar applications are available: [List of Similar Apps with Brief Explanations]. Would any of these meet your needs, or do you still want to request [App Name]?"`
         - **Wait for user response.**
           - If the user chooses a similar app, provide its details and end the flow.
           - If the user insists on the new app, continue to the next step.
    
       - If **no similar apps are found**:
         - Respond:  
           `"No similar applications are available. Would you like to proceed with a request for [App Name]?"`
         - **Wait for user confirmation.**
    
    4. **Collect Business Justification**
       - If the user confirms they want to request the new app:
         - Ask:  
           `"Could you please provide a business justification for requesting [App Name]? This will help us process your request."`
         - **Wait for user input.**
    
    5. **Create the Application Request**
       - After receiving the justification, use the “Create Item” action to submit the request to SharePoint.
       - Respond:  
         `"Thank you! Your request for [App Name] has been submitted. The IT team will review your request and follow up with you soon."

    ```

   
3. **Create the agent**

    - Click **Continue** to create the agent.

        - Does not hallucinate or suggest unlisted apps.
        - Provides a clear and relevant alternative based on function.
        - Offers the user a choice to proceed with the alternative or request the original app.

 

### 🧱 Step 9: Test Request Flow for an Unavailable Application

1. **Test Scenario: Ask for an Unlisted App**

   - In the test input box, type:
     
     `Is Skype available?`

   - Press **Enter** to submit the query.

2. **Expected Behavior**

   - The agent should:
   
     - Search the SharePoint list and confirm that Skype is not listed.
     - Use semantic matching to identify a functionally similar application.
     - Suggest Microsoft Teams as an alternative, with a brief explanation of its capabilities.
     
3. **Expected Response**
     
     ```
     Skype is not listed in the SharePoint applications list. However, Microsoft Teams is available, which is a collaboration platform that combines chat, video meetings, file sharing, and integrations with Microsoft 365 apps, helping teams stay connected and productive from anywhere.
    
     Would you like to proceed with Microsoft Teams, or would you like to request Skype as a new application?
    ```
    
4. **User Follow-Up**
    
   - In the test panel, respond with:
   
     `I would like to request Skype as a new app`
     
5. **Expected Agent Prompt**
    
     ```
     Could you please provide a business justification for requesting Skype as a new application? This will help in processing your request.
     ```


6. **Validation**

   - Confirm that the agent:

     - Follows the correct fallback logic when the app is not found.
     - Suggests a relevant alternative based on function.
     - Initiates the request workflow when the user insists on the original app.
     - Asks for a business justification as defined in the agent instructions.

   ![](images/test03.png)
   
#### ⏭️ What’s Next?


In the next section of this lab, you’ll learn how to extend Aria’s capabilities by adding a Connector that allows the agent to create new application requests directly in the SharePoint List. This will complete the end-to-end workflow from discovery to request submission.

3. **Create a New Variable**
   - Click on **Create a new variable**.
   
     ![](images/tp05.png)
     
   - Fill in the details for your first variable:
     - **Variable name:** `applicationName`
     - **Description:** `It is the name of the application that user is requesting.`

4. **Add Another Variable**
   - Click **Create a new variable** again.
   - Fill in the details for your second variable:
     - **Variable name:** `businessJustification`
     - **Description:** `It is the business justification for requesting the application.`

5. **Save Your Changes**
   - Make sure to save or apply your changes before leaving the page.

   ![](images/tp06.png)
   

**Result:**  
Your topic now has two input variables:
- `applicationName` — the name of the requested application
- `businessJustification` — the user’s reason for requesting it

These variables can now be passed into the topic from your main workflow, ensuring the topic is actionable only when the agent has collected all required information.

     ```

     
   - 📢 Tip: Adding a visual cue (like an emoji) and a gentle prompt encourages users to continue interacting if they wish.

     
     ![](images/tp35.png)  


2. (Optional) Offer Next Steps

   - You can further enhance the user experience by suggesting what they can do next. For example:
    
     ``` 
     Request cancelled. Would you like to:
     - See all available applications?
     - Start a new application request?
     - Restart the chat?
     ```

  - This keeps the conversation user-centric and proactive.

    Microsoft Teams: Microsoft Teams is a collaboration platform that combines chat, video meetings, file sharing, and integrations with Microsoft 365 apps, helping teams stay connected and productive from anywhere.

    Would Microsoft Teams meet your needs, or do you still want to request Zoom?
    ```
    
    ![](images/va02.png)  
    
    **User:**  
    `We need Zoom for external client meetings that require this platform.`
    
    **Agent (Expected):**  
   ```
   You are about to request the application: Zoom.

   Business justification: We need Zoom for external client meetings that require this platform..

   Do you want to proceed with submitting this request?
   ```
   
   ![](images/va03.png)  
   
   **User:**  
   `Yes, please`
   
   **Agent (Expected):**  
   ```

      ![](images/va06.png)  

5. **Validate the User Experience**
   - Ensure the agent:
     - Collects all required information (application name and business justification)
     - Offers a relevant alternative if available
     - Submits the request only after user confirmation
     - Sends a confirmation email
     - Provides a clear, friendly confirmation message in the chat


6. **(Optional) Test Cancellation Flow**

   - When prompted to confirm the request, select No, cancel.
   - Verify that the agent responds with a cancellation message and does not submit a request or send an email.
   
7. **Troubleshooting Tips**
   - If the request does not appear in SharePoint, check connector configuration and permissions.
   - If no email is received, verify the Outlook connector and spam/junk folders.
   - If the agent does not prompt for justification, review the topic flow and variable mapping.
